We don't yet know the actual challenges but we DO have a few images of
what the board will look like!

{% include gallery id="gameboard" %}

Notable features:

* There's a line direct from the base (so we can use line following)
* There is a huge bridge across to the opposing team's field! This may
be used for some interesting coopertition challenges.
