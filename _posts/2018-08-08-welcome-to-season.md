Welcome to this year's Breakthrough Robotics team! This will be an action-packed fall with a lot of moving parts and an incredibly
exciting new theme - Into Orbit!

Next week we will host our season opener, Bootcamp from **August 13 to August 16** at 6pm. All students who wish to participate in the FLL season
with Breakthrough should attend the Bootcamp. We will cover a few different topics:

* Learn about the Robot Mission Challenges
* Brainstorm ideas for the Project
* Build team core values

For those that were here last year, there will be a few changes this season. A few to note:

1. Breakthrough will be hosting TWO teams, not just ONE. Last year we had 11 students and only 10 spots for the competition.
This year, we expect 15-18 students and so we have two teams. **Teams will not be decided until end of August** - we will use the
Bootcamp to finalize the lists and will announce teams by end of August.

2. Software is new - this year, Illinois is participating in a pilot program to allow software other than Mindstorms for programming.
We will be experimenting with the newly supported MakeCode offered by Microsoft, which is a fantastic alternative that should make
the missions much easier.

3. The theme is Into Orbit! We will be exploring all sorts of outer space themed adventures. Check out the [robot resources] page.
