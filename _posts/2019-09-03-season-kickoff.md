Welcome to the Lego League Official Season! Tonight we begin the intense work to build a robot,
develop a solution to a problem in the community, and grow as a team.

Team members! Please read through the rules- it is up to YOU to understand what's required for your missions.

We will organize this season into two-week **sprints**. Every other Tuesday, we'll have a team planning meeting,
where we will use a **Kanban board** to organize which tasks each person will work on for that sprint. You can
choose what you want to focus on and then work for two weeks to achieve each milestone.

Practice is every Tuesday & Wednesday (except for the Wednesday Nov 27 before Thanksgiving). Please plan to come to
at least one practice every week, but come to as many as you can!
