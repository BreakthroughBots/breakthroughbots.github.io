Welcome back! This week is our Bootcamp week, which kicks off the 2019 FLL Season.
Here's the agenda for the week:

* Monday
* Tuesday
* Wednesday
* Thursday

Remember the three essential elements of an FLL season - core values, robot game, and
innovation project. This week we will make progress on all three. By the end of the
week, we will:

* Set up our team contract for how we behave
* Create a schedule of practices for the season
* Read and understand the rules of the robot game
* Brainstorm ideas for the innovation project

Our challenge set has not yet arrived, so we cannot yet begin actually practicing
with the robots. We will set up a later "build day" to create the mission models
before season kickoff. But we can make progress on learning the activities and models
so we are ready when it comes.
