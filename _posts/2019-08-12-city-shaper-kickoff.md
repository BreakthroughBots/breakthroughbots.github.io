Every summer, Breakthrough hosts a 4-day Bootcamp to kick off the season. This was our best
first day kickoff yet! We had eight hardy souls come out in the middle of summer
to begin tackling the twin challenges of the Robot Game and the Innovation Project.
Unfortunately, our challenge set has not yet arrived, but I think that will end up being
a blessing as it gives us more time to digest the rules and focus on preparation so that
the team will use their time more effectively when we get down to the business of actually
building & programming.

First, we watched the kickoff video:

Then, the kids split into groups to go through each mission and think about how it might
be accomplished. We used these awesome worksheets provided by the Seshan brothers (thanks!).

Already, I can tell that the kids AND coaches have a better understanding of all the missions
than any of the teams did last season. It pays to spend some time learning!

### Homework

Each team member should read through the *full* contents of the packet below, which covers the
rules of the robot game.
