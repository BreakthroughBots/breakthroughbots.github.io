The Breakthrough Robotics team performed better than expected last December
during the regional qualifier for the Hydrodynamics season. Team members Aiden,
Sammy, and Jayla led the robot to score the third highest score, with a final
run that came right down to the buzzer.

The robot ultimately was composed of several interlocking gears and had 5 runs,
each with their own attachments.

Additionally, the Breakthrough team won the Project award for outstanding
teamwork. They came up with a creative application that would solve a real
problem that humans encounter with water- how do people in remote areas of the
world construct a water filter using locally available materials? Our team
built a filter using rocks, sand, leaves, and plastic tubes and demonstrated
for the judges.

However, our weakest performance came in the Core Values exercise. The judges
did not see the team work well together, and we came up short.

Here are the final scores for each area:

This was a great showing for a team that had never worked that closely together
before. Next year, we will need to develop our teamwork through more Core Values exercises and bring the same level of intensity to the project, even as we
focus on applying some of the lessons from the Robot Game.
