On Tuesday, our Breakthrough Robotics team will pick up for another season, after having
taken last year off.

## What is FIRST Lego League?

The Breakthrough Robotics team participates in the First Lego League competition. In FLL,
student engage in research, problem-solving, coding and engineering â€“ building and programming a LEGO robot that navigates the missions of a robot game. As part of Challenge, teams also participate in a research project to identify and solve a relevant real-world problem.

This year, the season theme is **Cargo Connects** with a focus on real-world transportation
and supply chains. There's a ton of info about the exact mission challenges and 
more specifics at the [FIRST Website](https://www.firstinspires.org/resource-library/fll/challenge/challenge-and-resources).

## Meetings
