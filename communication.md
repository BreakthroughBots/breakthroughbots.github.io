Email List

All students, parents, and coaches should be subscribed to the team@breakthroughbots.org email list. We will send updates roughly weekly to the list.

Team Drive

All team-related files will be stored in a central Team Drive this year. We will store all PDFs from First Lego League, mission instructions, rules, etc, as well as
Google Docs and Slides related to the project and mission strategy. We also have folders for the programs (with a .ev3 extension).

Check out the recent updates section of this site for posts as the season progresses. Important information will always come via email so checking this is optional (but fun!).
Students or coaches can write posts by emailing luke@breakthroughbots.org with their post content.
