The theme for the 2018-19 season was Into Orbit - all activities and
project revolved around humans in outer space (especially for long term space travel).


## Robot Game

### Challenges

There are 15 challenges, each with different variants of possible scoring. Click on each image to read the detailed description. Read each

The [mission model building instructions](http://www.firstlegoleague.org/missionmodelbuildinginstructions) and [field setup guide](https://firstinspiresst01.blob.core.windows.net/fll/2019/FIRST-FLL-2018-19-FieldSetup-Letter.pdf) will be helpful early in the season as we construct the table.

### Rules

Read the rules in full! Note that our rules include the extra addendum that allows us to use any software as well as include flash cards (which we probably won't use).

and come up with a solution.
