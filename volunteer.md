## What's involved in being a coach?

No programming or robotics experience required! After all, the LEGO robotics tools we use
are designed to be learned by kids. Adults are there to provide a sounding board, help
kids stay on track and generally facilitate the team for the season.

The FLL Breakthrough Team meets Tuesdays & Thursdays, 6:30-8:30pm. The season typically starts
around Labor Day, and runs through the tournament in December. If the team does well, we may
have further meetings & competition in the winter.

Remember the core values: our job is to facilitate, but all kids do all the work. We don't use
kids to build robots - we use robots to build kids.

There are three levels of volunteer:

### Assistant Coach (Fall)

Available to join the team at least one night each week (Tuesdays and/or Thursdays). Assistant Coaches
build a relationship with the team members and provide huge value to the core team's accomplishments.

Assistant coaches should be vaccinated against COVID-19 and available to come in person.

### Occasional Innovation Project Mentor

One major aspect of FLL is the Innovation Project - kids need to research a topic, go on field trips,
come up with an innovative solution, and share it with experts.

For the 2021 season, our theme is **Cargo Connect**. If you have any relationship to any company or are
involved in shipping, packaging or transporting products (in any capacity), we'd love you to join
a meeting either virtually or in person and help the kids with their project.

### Robotics Teacher (Winter / Spring)

Breakthrough also runs Robotics training classes during winter & spring; more info will be posted.
